Artificial intelligence (AI) is revolutionizing the field of education, opening up new possibilities for personalized learning and increased accessibility for students with diverse needs. One area where AI is making a significant impact is in supporting visually impaired students.


As Helen Keller once said, “The only thing worse than being blind is having sight but no vision.” Only 10% of the Visually Impaired are Braille Literate, yet 90% of the literate are employed! For visually impaired students, the challenges of accessing educational materials and keeping up with their sighted peers can be daunting. However, AI-driven solutions are now providing new hope and opportunities.


Recent studies show that 72% of students using AI-driven personalized learning platforms feel more engaged in their studies. By leveraging AI to adapt content, provide audio descriptions, and enable voice commands, these platforms are making education more accessible and enjoyable for visually impaired learners.
